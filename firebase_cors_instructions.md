To resolve the photo upload issue, you'll need to configure CORS on your Firebase Storage bucket. This allows your web application (running on `https://watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.web.app`) to make requests to your storage bucket (`watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.firebasestorage.app`).

Here's how you can do it using the Google Cloud Shell:

1.  **Open Google Cloud Shell:** Go to your Google Cloud Console for the project `watagandental-inventory-e6e7b` and activate the Cloud Shell.

2.  **Create a CORS configuration file:**
    *   In the Cloud Shell, create a new file named `cors.json`. You can use `nano cors.json` or `vim cors.json` to create and edit the file.
    *   Paste the following content into `cors.json`:

        ```json
        [
          {
            "origin": ["https://watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.web.app"],
            "method": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "HEAD"],
            "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"],
            "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
          }
        ]
        ```

3.  **Apply the CORS configuration to your bucket:**
    *   Run the following `gsutil` command in the Cloud Shell, replacing `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with your actual bucket name (which should be `watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.firebasestorage.app` based on your `app.js`):

        ```bash
        gsutil cors set cors.json gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
        ```
        So, the command will be:
        ```bash
        gsutil cors set cors.json gs://watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.firebasestorage.app
        ```

4.  **Verify the CORS configuration (optional but recommended):**
    *   You can check the configuration by running:
        ```bash
        gsutil cors get gs://watagandental-inventory-e6e7b.firebasestorage.app
        ```
    *   This should output the JSON configuration you just set.

**After completing these steps, please let me know so I can proceed to the next step in our plan, which is to test the photo upload functionality.**

If you encounter any issues or do not have direct access to perform these steps, please inform the person who manages your Google Cloud / Firebase project.
