/* Custom styles for mobile responsiveness */
/* Minimal custom CSS. Relying on DaisyUI drawer and Tailwind utilities. */

/* Ensure sections within mainContent behave on very small screens if needed.
   Most DaisyUI/Tailwind components should be responsive by default.
   This is a common override if direct children of a flex/grid container
   don't shrink properly or if they have fixed widths.
   The cards used in index.html are `w-full` or responsive via grid,
   so this might not be strictly necessary.
   Keeping it commented out for now, can be reinstated if layout issues appear.
